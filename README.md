# Turtle-Direction-Guessing-Game
This project is a small game built using Python, Turtle Graphics, and
Tkinter. The player guesses which direction the turtle will move. If the
guess matches the randomly chosen direction, the score increases.

The game combines a graphical turtle movement window with a separate
Tkinter-based GUI panel for interaction.

## Features

-   Turtle moves visually on the Turtle Graphics screen.
-   Tkinter GUI for buttons and score display.
-   Four direction choices: Up, Down, Left, Right.
-   Score updates based on correct guesses.
-   Clean interface with labels and buttons.
-   Exit button that closes both windows safely.

## How It Works

1.  The user clicks a direction button in the Tkinter window.
2.  The program randomly selects one of four directions.
3.  The turtle moves 50 units in the chosen direction on the Turtle
    screen.
4.  The score updates if the user guessed correctly.
5.  The result of each round is shown in the GUI.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Tkinter
-   Turtle module

## How to Run

1.  Install Python if it is not already installed.
2.  Save the script as `direction_guessing_game.py`.
3.  Run the script:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    python direction_guessing_game.py

Two windows will open: - Turtle movement window - Tkinter control window

## Future Improvements

-   Difficulty levels
-   Timer system
-   Sounds
-   Restart button
